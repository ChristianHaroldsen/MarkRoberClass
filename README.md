# MarkRoberClass
In July of 2022, a friend and I took Mark Rober's Creative Engineering class. These are the projects I produced during the four week class.

The class was a lot of fun. One of the most interesting challenges for me was the time constraint. I had to complete each assignment in a limited amount of time, while I was keeping my daily job and routine, leaving me very littile time. This constraint actually gave me more focus and from that came a shocking amount of creativity.

This class really showed the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) in effect. I was able to brainstorm a huge list of ideas in a short period of time, pare them down to the do-able and intereseting ones, foresee problems, and creating a working prototype within less than a week. I normally work over 10x that timeline, if I even find the motivation to do so with life being what it is. This opened my eyes to how much more potential I have if I just dedicate to a project with a timeframe.

I'm putting these here so I can remind myself how much fun it is to be creative and just get something out there. Most of these ideas are by no means viable products to go to market or accomplish some grand goal, or even work moving past the first prototype stage. But they were all made with minimal money, a little bit of time, and a whole lot of fun.

# Part 1: Mechanical Engineering
This challenge's criteria were to make something involving food, using only mechanical components.

The Snack Mag is for when you're out shooting on the range and need a convenient place to store snackies. In this case a container with the same dimensions of a STANAG magazine fits into any existing gear you own to store your other magazines, allowing convenient storage and access alongside all your other gear.

For the prototype I cut some scrap wood I had lying around. It was a ruler themed coat hanger before so it looked kind of strange afterwards, but the wood held and I was able to make it in only an hour or two for three different versions. One split in the middle and returned with a spring, the second split in the middle but only had magnets to hold it back in place, and the third had a small lever at the top that was thumb operated to open and close.

Prototyping worked as intended! I originally though I would go with the magnet version but the spring version was much easier to work with. I also found that splitting it in the center of the magazine made it very difficult to use, so I planned to just have a small portion of the top come off. I essentially took the best of two prototypes and removed the worst, so I'm really glad I did it! Plus it took almost no time at all.

For my final product I thought about cutting an existing magazine in half and modifying it but that seemed like it could have a lot of issues in the limited time I had. Instead I used some acrylic sheets that I cut and glued together. Of course my cuts weren't very straight so it was a bit off, but it worked.I glued a hinge to the back and a small spring to close the lid.

In my final video I used the only conveient small bits of food I had in large quantities handy: dog food. Some got in my mouth ðŸ¤¢.

# Part 2: Electrical Engineering 
The Electrical Engineering challenge was to use Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's, and other electronics in a way that involves art. I chose to create a device that seemed magical that could sit on a desk with no visible parts. It's even set up on a trio of spooky books to give it the evil scientist theme!

This started with the idead to have something that would be pleasing to put in an office. I used to work in a building that had a wall with bubbling water that changed colors and I always thought that was really cool and also relaxing. Since I work in Research and Development, something science-y seemed appropriate.

The basic idea was really simple: Have a container that filled and emptied with water with all the mechanisms hidden so it would look nice on a desk or wall. We had more than 10 extra plastic graduated cylinders in the lab so I thought "hey, why not 3?". From there I had a huge brainstorm of the potential variations I could do on the project. I could vary the time, add a speaker, add lights, make it Wifi connected, etc. etc. Because of the time constraints I settled on a program that would fill, hold, and drain at random intervals.

The prototype was as simple as ordering the components and making sure they worked. I drilled a hole in the bottom of the graduated cylinders and glued some tubing to them and hooked it up to a reservoir of water. I used a potentiometer to run the motor and sure enough, it pumped and held the water in the cylinder.

TODO: Coding was a PITA. Motors were all different.
