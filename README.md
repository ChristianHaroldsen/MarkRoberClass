# MarkRoberClass
In July of 2022, a friend and I took Mark Rober's Creative Engineering class. These are the projects I produced during the four week class.

The class was a lot of fun. One of the most interesting challenges for me was the time constraint. I had to complete each assignment in a limited amount of time, while I was keeping my daily job and routine, leaving me very littile time. This constraint actually gave me more focus and from that came a shocking amount of creativity.

This class really showed the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) in effect. I was able to brainstorm a huge list of ideas in a short period of time, pare them down to the do-able and intereseting ones, foresee problems, and creating a working prototype within less than a week. I normally work over 10x that timeline, if I even find the motivation to do so with life being what it is. This opened my eyes to how much more potential I have if I just dedicate to a project with a timeframe.

I'm putting these here so I can remind myself how much fun it is to be creative and just get something out there. Most of these ideas are by no means viable products to go to market or accomplish some grand goal, or even work moving past the first prototype stage. But they were all made with minimal money, a little bit of time, and a whole lot of fun.

# Part 1: Mechanical Engineering
This challenge's criteria were to make something involving food, using only mechanical components.

# Part 2: Electrical Engineering 
The Electrical Engineering challenge was to use Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's, and other electronics in a way that involves art. I chose to create a device that seemed magical that could sit on a desk with no visible parts. It's even set up on a trio of spooky books to give it the evil scientist theme!
